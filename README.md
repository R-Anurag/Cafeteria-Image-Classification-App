# üç¥ Food-Court Meal Classifier App  

An **Android application** powered by a **PyTorch-based image classification model** hosted on Heroku.  
The app detects Indian cafeteria meals from photos, retrieves **nutritional information** using the **Nutritionix API**, and even estimates **calorie burn from exercises**.

## Introduction
In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, making informed food choices is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  
This project bridges the gap between **cafeteria dining** and **nutritional awareness** by enabling users to:  

- üì∑ Detect meals using a **PyTorch image classification model**  
- ü•ó Retrieve calorie and nutrient information via the **Nutritionix API**  
- üèÉ Estimate calorie burn from exercises  
- üì± Access results through an **Android app**  

Whether you‚Äôre a student, fitness enthusiast, or simply curious about your meal‚Äôs impact, this app empowers you to make smarter lifestyle choices.

## Problem Definition
The project addresses the following challenges:  

- **Dish Detection** ‚Üí Identify cafeteria meals using the phone camera.  
- **Hosting the ML Model** ‚Üí Deployed on Heroku, predictions returned via API.  
- **Nutritional Information Retrieval** ‚Üí Integrated with Nutritionix API to fetch calorie and macro data.  
- **Exercise Calorie Burn** ‚Üí Calculate calories burned by activities to promote balanced choices.  
- **User-Friendly Interface** ‚Üí Android frontend built with Kivy.

## Overview
The solution consists of three major components:  

1. **ML Backend (PyTorch Model)**  
   - Trained on Indian meal images (Aloo Paratha, Set Dosa, Chhole Bhature, Idli, Vada, Poori Sagu, Kesari Bhath).  
   - Hosted on **Heroku** to provide predictions via REST API.  

2. **Nutrition API Integration**  
   - **Nutritionix API** used to retrieve calories and macros for detected meals.  
   - Also used to estimate **exercise-related calorie burn**.  

3. **Android Frontend (Kivy App)**  
   - Captures images, sends them to backend, and displays results.  
   - Provides pie charts (carbs, protein, fats) and bar charts (prediction confidence).  
   - Handles Android hardware integration: Camera, Storage, Permissions, File Chooser.

## üçõ Supported Meals
The model currently recognizes the following Indian dishes:  
- Aloo Paratha  
- Set Dosa  
- Chhole Bhature  
- Idli  
- Vada  
- Poori Sagu  
- Kesari Bhath  

The dataset can be easily extended to include more meals.

## üß™ Challenges and Research
During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered, leading to valuable research and learning:  

### üîπ Dataset Creation
- **Challenge**: No publicly available dataset for Indian cafeteria meals.  
- **Solution**: Built a custom dataset using `bing-image-downloader` - a custom python script to scrape images. Each food class had ~100 images. Filtered out the remo
- **Learning**: Dataset quality and diversity are critical for ML performance. Future improvements could include crowdsourced images or curated datasets.  

### üîπ ML Model Hosting
- **Challenge**: Deploying PyTorch models with limited resources.  
- **Solution**: Used **Heroku** with free credits from GitHub Student Developer Pack.  
- **Learning**: Model optimization and efficient request handling were essential to reduce response times.  

### üîπ API Integration
- **Challenge**: Using Nutritionix API with authentication (App ID, API key) and handling request limits.  
- **Solution**: Integrated robust error handling for API calls (timeouts, invalid input, server-side errors).  
- **Learning**: Secure key management and API rate-limit handling are crucial for production apps.  

### üîπ Asynchronous UI
- **Challenge**: Fetching API and ML results caused UI freezes in Kivy.  
- **Solution**: Implemented **multithreading** and Kivy‚Äôs `@mainthread` decorators to keep UI responsive.  
- **Learning**: Concurrency in Python-Kivy apps requires careful thread-safe updates to UI components.  

### üîπ Android Hardware Access
- **Challenge**: Kivy does not natively support advanced Android features like CameraX, scoped storage, and runtime permissions.  
- **Solution**: Integrated custom Python-Java bridges using `pyjnius`:
  - `camerax_provider` for CameraX API  
  - `SharedStorage` for MediaStore integration  
  - `AndroidPermissions` for runtime permission handling  
  - `Chooser` for gallery image selection  
- **Learning**: Deep understanding of Android APIs was needed to bridge Python with native functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Python (Kivy, Matplotlib)  
- **Backend**: PyTorch, Flask (Heroku)  
- **APIs**: Nutritionix API  
- **Dataset**: Collected via `bing-image-downloader`
